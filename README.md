# dotfiles

This repo is where I keep my base installation scripts. It saves me time when I need to setup a new system.

It all started because I always forget which PS1 value I have to set to have my branches on the prompt. Tired of searching stack overflow every time, now I can go to my own repo and be happy. ^_^

I don't expect this to be useful to anyone else, but feel free to use it at your own risk.

## Install Linux

```sh
sudo ./setup_linux.sh
source ~/.bash_profile
```
